# project_fusion
This is a collection of SQL, scripts, and programs I use for converting various ERPs to JDE E1 9.2.  
Including: Infor Visual Manufacturing, Mapics / Infor XA, Sage, and some home-grown systems.

The code in this repository is tailored and project-specific.  Visit http://jdetables.com for full schema documentation, VMs, and other great information about the latest E1 release.
